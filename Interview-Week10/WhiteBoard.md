## White Board Challenges
<b>Partner : </b> Tom Bowers

<b>What we did : </b> Tom and I went back and forth solving whiteboard problems on Editabit. One would read off the challenge while the other solved it on the whiteboard. We then gave feedback on the answer.

<b>Things to improve :</b> 
  - Going through my thought process more.

  - Doing more challenges in the future
